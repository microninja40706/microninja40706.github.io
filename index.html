      Hey there! It's MicroNinja40706. I'm making a portfolio here off-platform for my Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Path. Whew, what a mouthful.

      What I'll be doing is updating this as I go through the course to add various things. This is a dev diary.

      Also, don't mind me... I'm going through an "Arial is professional and visually pleasing" phase. I'll snap out of it, I'm sure.
